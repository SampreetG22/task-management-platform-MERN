2. If the user is willing to run the development server, clone the repo locally and follow the below steps
3. The project folder consists of two folders **client** and **server**. The client consists of React code, whereas the server consists of Node.js, Express, and Mongo connection codes.
4. To start the frontend server, enter cd client and run npm i install the necessary dependencies. Once installed run npm start and this will the development server on localhost:3000.
